## Youtube-Adview-Prediction
This project aims to predict the number of views an advertisement will receive on YouTube. By leveraging machine learning techniques, including various regression models and neural networks, we can forecast ad performance based on historical data. The project covers data acquisition, preprocessing, visualization, model building, and evaluation.

## Data
The file train.csv contains metrics and other details of about 15000 youtube videos. The metrics include number of views, likes, dislikes, comments and apart from that published date, duration and category are also included. The train.csv file also contains the metric number of adviews which is our target variable for prediction. The data needs to be refined and cleaned before feeding in the algorithms for better results.
